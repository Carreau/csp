## `pip`

We ship binary wheels to install CSP on MacOS and Linux via `pip`:

```bash
pip install csp
```

## `conda` (coming soon)

We plan to create conda packages on conda-forge and ship binaries for Windows in
the near future.

## Source installation

For other platforms, follow the instructions to [build CSP from
source](Build-CSP-from-Source).
